There are two implementations in simple.rb and allclasses.rb
Both can be run from test_robot the robot that is run is determined by the value
of TestRobot::@@RobotClass  valid values are  Robot or Robot2

Robot in simple.rb is uses
  case statements  which have the advantage that the set of alternatives can be easily compared.

Robot2 in allclasses.rb is an example of using double dispatching between the command,heading ad the robot
  The purpose of this example to be the construction of more elaborate consistency checks fore example I anticipated building
  random command sequence and then calculating a reversing command sequence and then seeing if the robot got back to the start.

I have not tested the robot against each other.
